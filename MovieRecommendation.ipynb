    "# Predicting Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common uses of big data is to predict what users want.  This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark ML][sparkml] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.\n",

We will work with 10 million ratings from 72,000 users on 10,000 movies, collected by [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). This dataset is can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/. You may want to start with a smaller version of the dataset. Both datasets are also available on Blackboard. \n",

    "    - The average of all the movie's ratings\n",

    "In this course, you have learned about many of the basic transformations and actions that Spark allows us to apply to distributed datasets.  Spark also exposes some higher level functionality; in particular, Machine Learning using a component of Spark called [MLlib][mllib].  In this part, you will learn how to use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations using the movie data we have been analyzing.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to use a technique called [collaborative filtering][collab]. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The image at the right (from [Wikipedia][collab]) shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n",

    "\n",
    "For movie recommendations, we start with a matrix whose entries are movie ratings by users (shown in red in the diagram below).  Each column represents a user (shown in green) and each row represents a particular movie (shown in blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since not all users have rated all movies, we do not know all of the entries in this matrix, which is precisely why we need collaborative filtering.  For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The [Alternating Least Squares][als] algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.  Then we \"alternate\" and pick the best user factors given fixed movie factors.\n",

    "### (2b) Alternating Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will use the Apache Spark ML Pipeline implementation of Alternating Least Squares, [ALS](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS). ALS takes a training dataset (DataFrame) and several parameters that control the model creation process. To determine the best values for the parameters, we will use ALS to train several models, and then we will select the best model and use the parameters from that model in the rest of this lab exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process we will use for determining the best model is as follows:\n",
    "1. Pick a set of model parameters. The most important parameter to model is the *rank*, which is the number of columns in the Users matrix (green in the diagram above) or the number of rows in the Movies matrix (blue in the diagram above). In general, a lower rank will mean higher error on the training dataset, but a high rank may lead to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).  We will train models with ranks of 4, 8, and 12 using the `training_df` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the appropriate parameters on the `ALS` object:\n",
    "    * The \"User\" column will be set to the values in our `userId` DataFrame column.\n",
    "    * The \"Item\" column will be set to the values in our `movieId` DataFrame column.\n",
    "    * The \"Rating\" column will be set to the values in our `rating` DataFrame column.\n",
    "    * We'll using a regularization parameter of 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Read the documentation for the [ALS](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS) class **carefully**. It will help you accomplish this step.\n",
    "3. Have the ALS output transformation (i.e., the result of [ALS.fit()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS.fit)) produce a _new_ column\n",
    "   called \"prediction\" that contains the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create multiple models using [ALS.fit()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS.fit), one for each of our rank values. We'll fit\n",
    "   against the training data set (`training_df`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For each model, we'll run a prediction against our validation data set (`validation_df`) and check the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We'll keep the model with the best error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are we doing our own cross-validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge for collaborative filtering is how to provide ratings to a new user (a user who has not provided *any* ratings at all). Some recommendation systems choose to provide new users with a set of default ratings (e.g., an average value across all ratings), while others choose to provide no ratings for new users. Spark's ALS algorithm yields a NaN (`Not a Number`) value when asked to provide a rating for a new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ML Pipeline's [CrossValidator](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) with ALS is thus problematic, because cross validation involves dividing the training data into a set of folds (e.g., three sets) and then using those folds for testing and evaluating the parameters during the parameter grid search process. It is likely that some of the folds will contain users that are not in the other folds, and, as a result, ALS produces NaN values for those new users. When the CrossValidator uses the Evaluator (RMSE) to compute an error metric, the RMSE algorithm will return NaN. This will make *all* of the parameters in the parameter grid appear to be equally good (or bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the discussion on [Spark JIRA 14489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14489) about this issue. There are proposed workarounds of having ALS provide default values or having RMSE drop NaN values. Both introduce potential issues. We have chosen to have RMSE drop NaN values. While this does not solve the underlying issue of ALS not predicting a value for a new user, it does provide some evaluation value. We manually implement the parameter grid search process using a for loop (below) and remove the NaN values before using RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a production application, you would want to consider the tradeoffs in how to handle new users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This cell will likely take a couple of minutes to run."
